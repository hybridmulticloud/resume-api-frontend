    <h2>Project Portfolio – Cloud Resume Challenge</h2>

    <!-- Project: HybridMulti.Cloud Portfolio Site -->
    <h3>HybridMulti.Cloud Serverless Portfolio Website</h3>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>I wanted to showcase my cloud architecture and DevOps skills by building an online resume that goes beyond a static page. The goal was to implement the <em>Cloud Resume Challenge</em>: deploy my personal resume site on the cloud with a live visitor counter, demonstrating proficiency in AWS services, serverless computing, and Infrastructure as Code.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>The portfolio site was built as a fully serverless application on AWS. The resume frontend is a static website hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed worldwide via Amazon CloudFront CDN for low-latency access. For dynamic functionality, I created a backend API using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. Each visit to the site triggers an API Gateway endpoint that invokes a Lambda function, which increments a visitor count stored in a DynamoDB table and returns the updated count to be displayed on the page. All infrastructure components (S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB) are defined and provisioned through Terraform scripts. A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment: on every code push, Terraform is run to apply any infrastructure changes and update the Lambda function code. This design ensures the entire solution is maintained as code and requires no servers to manage.</p>

    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>The result is a production-grade, cloud-native personal website (hybridmulti.cloud) that not only presents my resume but also demonstrates my cloud engineering capabilities. The homepage displays a real-time visit counter, which confirms that the serverless backend is working – every refresh shows the incremented tally of visits. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in tying together cloud services with IaC and CI/CD, and I proved out a working solution that I can show to employers as evidence of my skills. The project solidified my knowledge of AWS serverless architectures and modern DevOps practices.</p>

    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> AWS (Amazon S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB), Terraform, GitHub (GitHub Actions CI/CD), Python (boto3 SDK for Lambda).</p>
